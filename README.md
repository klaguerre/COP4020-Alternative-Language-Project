# COP4020-Alternative-Language-Project
To practice and demonstrate proficiency in using an alternative programming language of your choice(Java).

1. Which programming language and version did you pick?

Java SE 22.0.1

2. Why did you pick this programming language?

It's popular programming langauage used in a wide variety of applications which includes web development, mobile development, software development, and data science.

3. How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

For OOP, java is strong in the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Key features include classes, objects, inheritance, and abstraction. Classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter help with file handling. You can read from and write to files using these classes. Java supports conditional statements such as if, else, and switch. Assignment statements in Java are straightforward, using the '=' operator to assign a value to a variable. Java supports different types of loops. Those loops include for, while, and do-while. In Java, methods are used to define reusable blocks of code. Java also supports method overloading and overriding. Java has various frameworks for unit testing, with JUnit being the most popular. Unit testing in Java helps ensure the correctness of individual methods or classes of code. Java has a robust exception handling mechanism using try, catch, finally, and throw blocks.

4. List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

Apache Commons CSV: It's a library provided by the Apache Software Foundation that simplifies the handling of CSV files in Java. Apache Commons CSV provides a simple and intuitive API for reading and writing CSV data, making it easy to integrate into the project.
JUnit: Used it for testing framework for the Java program. JUnit is a proven framework that helps ensure the reliability of Java code to write repeatable tests.
OpenCSV: A library that makes it easy to read from and write to CSV files in Java. OpenCSV has built-in capabilities to map CSV columns directly to object fields. This can reduce the boilerplate code required for parsing CSV files.
